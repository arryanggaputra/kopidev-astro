If you try to run `pod install`  or perform a similar task using the command line in macOS may you  face a problem like this

```bash
checking whether the C compiler works... no
xcrun: error: SDK "iphoneos" cannot be located
xcrun: error: SDK "iphoneos" cannot be located
xcrun: error: SDK "iphoneos" cannot be located
xcrun: error: unable to lookup item 'Path' in SDK 'iphoneos'

...

configure: WARNING: 'missing' script is too old or missing
configure: error: in `/Users/arryangga/Library/Caches/CocoaPods/Pods/Release/Flipper-Glog/0.3.6-1dfd6':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

To fix this issue is very simple, you can fix this using the command line, or by using the Xcode application itself.
