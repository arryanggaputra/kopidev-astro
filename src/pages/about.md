# What is Kopidev?

To answer what Kopidev is, my answer is quite simple: Kopidev is a **Website**, a **Community**, and a **Technology Media Platform** that serves as a hub for developers, IT enthusiasts, and technology professionals worldwide.

From my personal perspective as the owner of this website, Kopidev represents **"something special"** - a platform that serves as a gathering place for programmers, tech enthusiasts, developers, and anyone passionate about Technology & Information. This platform is designed to be a space for learning, connecting, and sharing knowledge.

# The Origin of the Name "Kopidev"

The name "Kopidev" came from a creative combination of two elements that resonate with the developer community:

The word **"dev"** is short for **"Developer"** - since most of our community members are Software Developers.

The word **"kopi"** (coffee in Indonesian) represents the beloved beverage that many Software Developers enjoy, and which accompanies them during their work sessions. Coffee and coding go hand in hand in developer culture.

# History of Kopidev

Kopidev actually started back in 2015, when my friend **Davis Rifandi** and I came up with the idea to create an IT media platform. At that time, we were both part of the Microsoft Student Partner program, which gave us the responsibility to share our technology knowledge with others.

Later, another friend of mine named **Christian Saragih**, who was also a Microsoft Student Partner, joined us in managing Kopidev. So the three of us ran the website and social media pages starting from 2014.

After 2 years, due to individual commitments like college coursework and other responsibilities, we all decided to pause Kopidev activities. We completely stopped - the website, social media pages, and Twitter had no activity at all. I even forgot all the credentials for the Kopidev accounts. But now everything is back online again. I have to thank Google Chrome for its sync feature!

In **2019**, my passion for sharing knowledge with the public through writing began to grow again. Instead of creating a new website and social media presence from scratch, I decided to revive the Kopidev name, this time with the domain [kopi.dev](http://kopi.dev).

Currently, I'm running Kopidev solo, focusing on creating valuable content for the global developer community. Christian Saragih is now a software engineer in Bali, and Davis Rifandi became a teacher in Malang. I myself continue as a Remote Software Engineer. I pray for their continued success in their respective paths, and I'm grateful to have had such amazing collaborators.

# Kenangan Kopidev Yang Dulu

Teman saya yang lain (**Akhmad Arif Munandar**) juga ikut membantu kami, saat dia sedang melaksanakan tugas akhirnya, karena kebutuan dia di jurusan multimedia, dia membantu kami untuk membuat video perkenalan tentang Kopidev, begini hasilnya:

Dan dulu kita sering banget ngadain event, kita famous banget waktu dulu. 😆Harapan saya adalah, semoga Kopidev dapat menjadi terkenal kembali seperti dulu.
